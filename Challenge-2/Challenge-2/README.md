# Challenge-2

Second week challlenge
Hyman L Jarrett Junior
Project was created as a starting point in order to showcase my HTML abilities. The purpose of this project was to highlight my abilities and coding using CSS and HTML, and to link to all Subsequent projects to highlight a growth in ability in both HTML and CSS. The issues that I have been facing and using CSS involve slight syntax errors. Practice in writing HTML and modifying HTML and CSS is something that will take repetition. I tried to address all of the criteria for the second week challenge. I may not have achieved all of the criteria, but I believe I got a good start on building my HTML and CSS skills. I don't have a lot of projects to link to. That will change in the near future, and as those changes occur, I will add to this project to build out a fully complete and diverse portfolio.
I believe that I met all of the criteria, the navigation links scroll to a corresponding section. There is a link to the first challenge that link is larger in size than the other images on the page the page resizes correctly, and there are links to external Resources in the page.
